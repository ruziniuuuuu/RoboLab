# Galbot One Golf Description

USD description of the Galbot One Golf robot, used by the RoboLab Galbot Golf
embodiment (`robolab/robots/galbot_golf.py`).

## Checkout

This package was imported from the official Galbot description repository:

- Source: `https://github.com/GalaxyGeneralRobotics/galbot_one_golf_description`
- Revision: `b311f5ca1acf506e9b7026397e2c74fb2db11df6`

RoboLab retains only the USD assets, which are self-contained (meshes are
embedded in `usd/payloads/geometries.usd`; textures live under
`usd/Textures/`). The upstream URDF, MJCF, xacro, mesh, rviz, and launch
files are not used by RoboLab and were dropped. Use the source checkout at
the revision above when you need them (e.g. URDF for planning tools, or
regenerating descriptions from xacro).

## USD

The main USD entry point is `usd/galbot_one_golf.usda`. Related payloads and
textures are stored under `usd/`.

Variant sets on the root prim (defaults in bold): Physics (**physx**,
physics, none, mujoco), Robot (**none**, robot), Sensor (**none**, sensors).

## Fixed-base control profile

`robolab/robots/galbot_golf.py` uses the SynthNova
`galbot-one-golf-sim2real-v1` profile, from
`src/synthnova/robots/cfg/galbot_one_golf.toml` at revision
`24ae63bce2e5b5909f7e95228fb4d1cd176c6974`.
Arm stiffness and damping are averaged between the measured left/right values,
then rounded to the nearest integer. Other gains are rounded directly, with
half values rounded up (e.g. gripper stiffness 76.5 becomes 77).

| Arm joint | Source left stiffness / damping | Source right stiffness / damping | Applied to both arms |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3483.76 / 97.0301 | 3600.0 / 102.566 | 3542 / 100 |
| 2 | 3395.34 / 94.5673 | 3480.33 / 96.9345 | 3438 / 96 |
| 3 | 1144.9 / 31.8879 | 1144.52 / 31.8773 | 1145 / 32 |
| 4 | 1141.44 / 31.7915 | 1144.34 / 31.8723 | 1143 / 32 |
| 5 | 285.424 / 7.94966 | 286.78 / 7.98743 | 286 / 8 |
| 6 | 283.771 / 7.90362 | 283.84 / 7.90554 | 284 / 8 |
| 7 | 283.654 / 7.90037 | 283.654 / 7.90037 | 284 / 8 |

Stiffness is in N m/rad and damping in N m s/rad. Effort limits are 433/433/204/70/70
N m for the legs, 4 N m for the head, 180/180/90/90/30/30/30 N m per arm, and
1.5 N m per gripper. Specified profile velocity limits are retained. The source
does not specify head or gripper speed: the head retains its USD limit, and the
grippers retain RoboLab's existing 3.5 rad/s limit rather than falling back to
the USD's 0.5 rad/s. This preserves the existing closing-time limit; 3.5 rad/s
is not a speed calibration from the source profile. Wheels retain their USD
drive properties.

The robot root stays fixed. Robot-link gravity is disabled to approximate ideal
controller-side gravity compensation; gravity on task objects is unchanged.
This changes tracking/contact dynamics and can change benchmark results. It is
not a floating-base balancing or mobile-base gravity-compensation controller.
